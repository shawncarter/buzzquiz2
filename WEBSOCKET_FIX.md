# WebSocket Connection Fix for Buzz Quiz Game

## Problem

We've identified an issue with WebSocket connections in the Buzz Quiz Game where players were unable to connect properly, causing these symptoms:

- WebSocket connection errors in the browser console
- "Connection lost" messages for players
- Game not updating in real-time
- Players and host unable to communicate

## Solution

The issue was related to how WebSockets are handled in Django. The `runserver` command from Django doesn't fully support WebSockets through Django Channels.

### How to Fix It

1. **Use the correct server**: Run the application using Daphne (an ASGI server) instead of the Django development server.

   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```

2. **Diagnostic Tool**: Use the connection diagnostic page to verify that WebSockets are working properly:
   - For host: Click on "Connection Diagnostics" in the game information panel
   - For players: Click on "Connection Diagnostics" below the player name

3. **Check WebSocket URLs**: Ensure that WebSocket URLs are correct and follow this pattern:
   - For HTTP: `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/game/<game_code>/`
   - For HTTPS: `wss://yourdomain.com/ws/game/<game_code>/`

## Technical Details

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. Added better error handling and logging for WebSocket connections
2. Created a diagnostic tool for testing WebSocket connectivity
3. Updated the ASGI configuration to ensure proper initialization
4. Simplified the channel layer configuration
5. Provided a dedicated script to run the server with proper WebSocket support

## When to Use Each Server

- **Development with WebSockets**: Use `./run_server.sh` when you need real-time features
- **Development without WebSockets**: Use `python manage.py runserver` for simple HTTP requests
- **Production**: Use Daphne, uvicorn, or another ASGI server with proper WebSocket support

## Other Improvements

- Added sound generation using Web Audio API instead of relying on MP3 files
- Improved error handling for non-existent games
- Fixed HostCreateView by changing it from FormView to TemplateView
- Added logging to help diagnose future issues

If you encounter any other issues with WebSocket connections, check the server logs for detailed error messages.
